# TINY

TINY is a reduced version on [MINI](https://github.com/panique/mini), an extremely simple and easy to understand demo
PHP application. TINY is NOT a professional framework, it's the opposite: Just a tiny config-free application. 
It does not need mod_rewrite and therefore runs everywhere. If you just want to show some pages, do a few database calls 
and a little-bit of AJAX here and there, without reading in massive documentations of highly complex professional 
frameworks, then TINY might be very useful for you.

TINY's full folder/file structure is fully accessible from the web, be aware of that (like in Wordpress, Prestashop etc
too by the way). To prevent people from looking into your files/folder there are some workarounds (try to call a view 
file directly), but keep in mind that this is just made for quick prototypes and small sites, so be careful when using 
TINY in live situations.

## Features

- extremely simple, easy to understand
- runs nearly config-free everywhere
- simple structure
- demo CRUD actions: Create, Read, Update and Delete database entries easily
- demo AJAX call
- tries to follow PSR 1/2 coding guidelines
- uses PDO for any database requests, comes with an additional PDO debug tool to emulate your SQL statements
- commented code
- uses only native PHP code, so people don't have to learn a framework

## Requirements

- PHP 5.3.0+
- MySQL

## Installation

1. If you run TINY from within a sub-folder, edit the folder's name in application/config/config.php and change 
`define('URL_SUB_FOLDER', 'tiny-master');`. If you don't use a sub-folder, then simply comment out this line.  
2. Edit the database credentials in `application/config/config.php`
3. Execute the .sql statements in the `_installation/`-folder (with PHPMyAdmin for example).

Here's a simple tutorial on [How to install LAMPP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, PHPMyAdmin) on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/installsetup-basic-lamp-stack-linux-apache-mysql-php-ubuntu-14-04-lts/)
and the same for [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/setup-basic-lamp-stack-linux-apache-mysql-php-ubuntu-12-04/).

## Differences to MINI

TINY is a modified version of MINI, made to run in every environment. TINY does NOT need mod_rewrite.

MINI uses mod_rewrite to a.) create better URLs and b.) block public access to any folders and any files outside of /public, so users / attackers will not be able to call anything except index.php and the contents in /public, usually public files like .js, .css, images and so on. This also prevents attackers to have access to stuff like .git folder/files or to any temporary swap files of any files, sometimes generated by text-editors, IDEs,  FTP programs etc.

Applications / frameworks etc. that do not make use of mod_rewrite usually have the problem that every file inside their structure is directly callable, for example every .php file, or the wp-config.php, the configuration file of WordPress, is directly callable in masses of WordPress installations, sometimes even on very large sites. Usually okay, as the attacker will not see any output, but as lots of tools make temp-copies and swap files of a currently edited / uploaded file it might become critical. Bots and clever attackers have an easy game getting these clear-text-files. Non-PHP-files would be downloadable in plain-text, too (just imagine all the .inc files).

### What does this mean for TINY ?

Lot’s of hosting and development environments don’t have mod_rewrite activated and/or it’s impossible for the developer (for whatever reason), then TINY might be an alternative. Without mod_rewrite it’s not possible to block access to every folder/file in a really good way.

Therefore, TINY is not a good choice for live sites visited by the public. But to be honest, major parts of the internet still work like that, it’s disturbing how many – even big – sites let users / attackers call every .php files inside their structure and let them look into folders.

However, TINY has some workarounds: To prevent everybody from looking into your view files there’s a line of PHP in the beginning of every view file, asking if we are inside the application or not. If yes, the files is parsed, if not, PHP will stop parsing the file. This is how this looks in application/views/songs/edit.php

```php
<?php if (!$this) { exit(header('HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden')); } ?>
 
<!-- HTML stuff here -->
<div class="container">
```

To prevent people from looking into folders there are several index.php in these folders that do basically nothing. WordPress and other (low-security) applications do similar / same stuff:

```php
<?php
 
// This file is called when user/attacker tries to look into "/application/views/" 
// and simply gives back a 403 error. This is the most simply method to prevent people 
// from looking into a folder when mod_rewrite is not activated.
exit(header('HTTP/1.0 403 Forbidden'));
```

## Servers configs for

### NGINX

```nginx
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

    root /var/www/tiny;
    index index.php index.html index.htm;

    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$args;
    }

    location ~ \.php$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+\.php)(/.+)$;
        fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index index.php;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

## Goodies

TINY comes with a little [PDO debugger tool](https://github.com/panique/pdo-debug), trying to emulate your PDO-SQL
statements.

## Support

If you want to support TINY, then rent your next server at [Host1Plus](https://affiliates.host1plus.com/ref/devmetal/36f4d828.html) or 
[DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=40d978532a20).

## Quick-Start

#### The structure in general

The application's URL-path translates directly to the controllers (=files) and their methods inside 
application/controllers. 

`example.com/home/exampleOne` will do what the *exampleOne()* method in application/controllers/home.php says.

`example.com/home` will do what the *index()* method in application/controllers/home.php says.

`example.com` will do what the *index()* method in application/controllers/home.php says (default fallback).

`example.com/songs` will do what the *index()* method in application/controllers/songs.php says.

`example.com/songs/editsong/17` will do what the *editsong()* method in application/controllers/songs.php says and
will pass `17` as a parameter to it.

Self-explaining, right ?

#### Showing a view

Let's look at the exampleOne()-method in the home-controller (application/controllers/home.php): This simply shows
the header, footer and the example_one.php page (in views/home/). By intention as simple and native as possible.

```php
public function exampleOne()
{
    // load views
    require APP . 'views/_templates/header.php';
    require APP . 'views/home/example_one.php';
    require APP . 'views/_templates/footer.php';
}
```  

#### Working with data

Let's look into the index()-method in the songs-controller (application/controllers/songs.php): Similar to exampleOne,
but here we also request data. Again, everything is extremely reduced and simple: $this->model->getAllSongs() simply
calls the getAllSongs()-method in application/model/model.php.

```php
public function index()
{
    // getting all songs and amount of songs
    $songs = $this->model->getAllSongs();
    $amount_of_songs = $this->model->getAmountOfSongs();

   // load views. within the views we can echo out $songs and $amount_of_songs easily
    require APP . 'views/_templates/header.php';
    require APP . 'views/songs/index.php';
    require APP . 'views/_templates/footer.php';
}
```

For extreme simplicity, all data-handling methods are in application/model/model.php. This is for sure not really
professional, but the most simple implementation. Have a look how getAllSongs() in model.php looks like: Pure and
super-simple PDO.

```php
public function getAllSongs()
{
    $sql = "SELECT id, artist, track, link FROM song";
    $query = $this->db->prepare($sql);
    $query->execute();
    
    return $query->fetchAll();
}
```

The result, here $songs, can then easily be used directly
inside the view files (in this case application/views/songs/index.php, in a simplified example):

```php
<tbody>
<?php foreach ($songs as $song) { ?>
    <tr>
        <td><?php if (isset($song->artist)) echo htmlspecialchars($song->artist, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></td>
        <td><?php if (isset($song->track)) echo htmlspecialchars($song->track, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></td>
    </tr>
<?php } ?>
</tbody>
```

## Dear haters, trolls and everything-sucks-people...

... TINY is just a even more reduced version of MINI, which is a simple helper-tool I've created for my daily work, 
simply because it was much easier to setup and to handle than real frameworks. For several use-cases it's totally okay, does the job and there's absolutely no reason to discuss why it's "shit compared to Laravel", why it does not follow several MVC principles or why there's no personal unpaid support or no russian translation or similar weird stuff. The trolling against Open-Source-projects (and their authors) has really reached insane dimensions. 

I've written this unpaid, voluntarily, in my free-time and uploaded it on GitHub to share. It's totally free, for private and commercial use. If you don't like it, don't use it. If you see issues, then please write a ticket (and if you are really cool: I'm very thankful for any commits!). But don't bash, don't complain, don't hate. Only bad people do so.
